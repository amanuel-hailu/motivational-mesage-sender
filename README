# Reminder Scheduler with Quotes & Images

This project sends scheduled reminders containing a quote and an image to specified recipients via text message. Quotes are fetched from a designated quote API, and images are retrieved from an image API by passing a keyword.

## Features

- Schedule reminders at specific times or intervals.
- Fetch inspirational quotes from a quote-generating API.
- Retrieve related images from an image API using keywords.
- Send reminders with a quote and an image via SMS.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- API keys for the quote and image services
- Twilio or another service for sending SMS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reminder-scheduler.git
   cd reminder-scheduler
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   QUOTE_API_KEY=your_quote_api_key

   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token

   > **Note:** You can use any quote and image API you like. The ones used in this project are [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/).

## Usage

1. Run the script:
